# SVM
A supervised machine learning approach that may be applied to regression and classification problems is called Support Vector Machine (SVM). The primary goal of SVM is to identify the optimal boundary, also known as a hyperplane, for classifying the data.

An SVM algorithm determines the optimal boundary for classifying the data into distinct groups when it comes to classification. The margin, or the separation between the boundary and the nearest data points from each class, is maximized by the boundary selection. Support vectors are the closest data points.
